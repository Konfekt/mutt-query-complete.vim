INTRODUCTION
============

This plug-in allows Vim to complete names and email addresses in a mail buffer
by using the mutt address_query tool defined by `query_command`. This is
particularly useful when editing emails with `mutt` and `$edit_headers` is
set.

USAGE
=====

Consider editing a mail file in Vim with the following content:

    From: Lu Guanqun <guanqun.lu@gmail.com>
    To:   foo

Assuming your query tool has an entry like:

    foo@bar.com Foo Bar

Place the cursor right after `foo` and press `Ctrl+X Ctrl+U`. The result will
be:

From: Lu Guanqun <guanqun.lu@gmail.com>
    To:   Foo Bar foo@bar.com

SETUP
=====

Completion is enabled by default in all mail buffers. To add additional file
types to the completion list, modify `g:muttquery_filetypes` which defaults to
`[ 'mail' ]`.

The mutt query command is set to the value of `$query_command` by default. To
set a specific command path, add the following to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:muttquery_command = '$command'

For example, `$command` could be mutt_ldap.py %s

For different mail accounts with distinct query commands, use a folder hook in
`.muttrc`. For account `mailo`, add:

    folder-hook '~/.local/share/mbsync/mailo/' 'source
    "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/accounts/mailo"'

Then, in `"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/accounts/mailo"`, configure Vim with
>
    set editor = 'vim +"let g:muttquery_command=\"mutt_ldap.py --config
    \"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt-ldap/mailo.cfg\" %%s"'
<
